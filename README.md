# MultiSID Tester  
## A simple utility to test SIDs listening on different addresses  

By: **Darrell Westbury**  
Version: 0.9 (Beta)  
Preview Release: May 8th 2024   

## Background:
This is the first Assembly Language code I've written since 1992.
It's been a blast rolling the sleeves up again, but I'm 'clearly' a bit rusty.

## Usage:
I'm hoping that the simple Grid-based navigation system is easy, intuitive and straight forward to use.
I've added an info page to explain the controls, although they should me mostly self-explanatory

## Credits:
When I was looking for a Music Player routine that I could modify easily to support multiple SID addresses,
I was thrilled to find some code by **Cadaver** that just what the Doctor ordered.

## Other great tools I used include:
* KickAssembler: http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html
* VICE: https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/
* Ultimate II+ Cartridge: https://www.ultimate64.com/
* EVO64: https://www.evo64.com/
* PETSCII Editor: https://petscii.krissz.hu/

## Considerations:
* This is an early work in progress, and I'm sure there are many bugs and opportunities for improvements to be made.
* You will experience instability if you're using a cartridge like RetroReplay and tryin to use SIDs addressing in the $DE00-$DFE0 range.
* I welcome suggestions and feedback, so please feel free to reach out to me at: DWestbury_505@msn.com
